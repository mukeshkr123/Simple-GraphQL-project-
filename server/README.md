# Getting Started with GraphQL and Building a GraphQL Server from Scratch

This README will guide you through the basics of GraphQL and how to set up a GraphQL server from scratch. GraphQL is a query language for your API, and it's a powerful tool for fetching the data you need in a flexible and efficient way.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for your API that allows you to request only the data you need, making it more efficient and flexible compared to REST APIs. It enables clients to request exactly what they want and nothing more.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. If not, download and install them from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Creating a Simple GraphQL Server

1. Create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-graphql-server
   cd my-graphql-server
   ```

````

2. Initialize your project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install express express-graphql graphql
   ```

4. Create an `app.js` file for your Express server:

   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   const app = express();
   const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
   const {
     GraphQLSchema,
     GraphQLObjectType,
     GraphQLString,
   } = require("graphql");

   const RootQuery = new GraphQLObjectType({
     name: "RootQueryType",
     fields: {
       hello: {
         type: GraphQLString,
         resolve: () => "Hello, GraphQL!",
       },
     },
   });

   const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
     query: RootQuery,
   });

   app.use(
     "/graphql",
     graphqlHTTP({
       schema,
       graphiql: true,
     })
   );

   app.listen(4040, () => {
     console.log("GraphQL server is running on http://localhost:4040/graphql");
   });
   ```

5. Run your server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## Defining Your Schema

In the example above, we defined a simple GraphQL schema with a single query called `hello`. You can create more complex schemas with multiple types and queries to suit your needs.

## Running and Testing Your GraphQL Server

- Visit `http://localhost:4040/graphql` in your web browser to use the interactive GraphiQL tool for testing your GraphQL queries.
